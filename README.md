# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a web application. The system securely manages user accounts, assigns roles, and grants access to features based on the user's assigned role.

## **Features**

### **User Registration:**
- Allows new users to register with a unique username, password, and a selectable role (Admin, Moderator, User).
- Passwords are securely hashed using werkzeug.security.

### **User Authentication:**
- Users can log in using their username and password.
- The system validates the credentials and establishes a session upon successful login.

### **Role-Based Authorization:**
- Users are assigned one of the following roles: Admin, Moderator, or User.
- Role-specific routes restrict access to certain pages:
  - **Admin**: Access to Admin Dashboard.
  - **Moderator**: Access to Moderator Dashboard and lower-level functionalities.
  - **User**: Limited access to general features.

### **Session Management:**
- User sessions are maintained during the login session and cleared upon logout.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Flask**: Python web framework for handling routes, templates, and sessions.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: ORM for managing the SQLite database.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing user credentials and roles.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for styling and responsive design.

## **System Architecture**

### **Models:**
- **User**: Stores user credentials (username, hashed password) and their assigned role.

### **Routes:**
- **/register/**: Handles user registration.
- **/login/**: Authenticates users and establishes their session.
- **/logout/**: Ends the user session.
- **/dashboard/**: Displays a dashboard accessible to all authenticated users.
- **/admin/**: Restricted to Admins.
- **/moderator/**: Accessible by Admins and Moderators.
